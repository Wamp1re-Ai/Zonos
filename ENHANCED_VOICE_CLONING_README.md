# Enhanced Voice Cloning for Zonos TTS

This enhanced voice cloning system addresses common issues with voice cloning such as inconsistent timing, unnatural pauses, speed variations, and gibberish generation. The improvements include better audio preprocessing, quality analysis, and optimized parameters for more consistent and natural speech generation.

## üöÄ Key Improvements

### 1. **Audio Preprocessing Pipeline**
- **Silence Removal**: Automatically removes leading/trailing silence for better voice characteristics
- **Audio Normalization**: Normalizes amplitude to prevent clipping and ensure consistent levels
- **Optimal Length Extraction**: Extracts optimal voice samples (10-20 seconds) from longer audio
- **Mono Conversion**: Ensures consistent mono audio processing

### 2. **Voice Quality Analysis**
- **SNR Estimation**: Estimates signal-to-noise ratio for quality assessment
- **Dynamic Range Analysis**: Analyzes audio dynamic range for quality scoring
- **Quality Score**: Provides normalized quality score (0-1) for voice samples
- **Automatic Warnings**: Warns users about poor quality audio that may affect results

### 3. **Optimized Parameters**
- **Conservative Sampling**: Uses more conservative sampling parameters (min_p=0.05 vs 0.1)
- **Reduced Repetition Penalty**: Lower repetition penalty (1.5 vs 3.0) to avoid unnatural pauses
- **Controlled Pitch Variation**: Optimized pitch_std (15.0 vs 20.0) for consistent voice
- **Slower Speaking Rate**: More controlled speaking rate (12.0 vs 15.0) for better timing
- **Quality-Adaptive Parameters**: Automatically adjusts parameters based on voice quality

### 4. **Enhanced Generation Control**
- **Reproducible Results**: Seed support for consistent generation
- **Progress Tracking**: Built-in progress bars for long generations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Support for various audio formats and sample rates

## üìã Common Issues Fixed

| Issue | Root Cause | Solution |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Long Pauses** | High repetition penalty (3.0) | Reduced to 1.5 with shorter window |
| **Speed Variations** | Inconsistent speaking_rate parameter | Optimized to 12.0 with quality-based adjustment |
| **Gibberish Speech** | Aggressive sampling (min_p=0.1) | Conservative sampling (min_p=0.05) |
| **Unnatural Timing** | Poor audio preprocessing | Enhanced preprocessing with silence removal |
| **Inconsistent Voice** | High pitch variation (20.0) | Reduced to 15.0 with quality adaptation |
| **Poor Quality** | No quality analysis | Automatic quality assessment and warnings |

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Quick Voice Cloning (Simplest)
```python
from enhanced_voice_cloning import quick_voice_clone

result = quick_voice_clone(
    text="Hello, this is enhanced voice cloning!",
    voice_audio_path="path/to/voice_sample.wav",
    output_path="cloned_speech.wav",
    language="en-us",
    seed=42  # For reproducible results
)

print(f"Quality Score: {result['quality_metrics']['quality_score']:.3f}")
```

### Advanced Voice Cloning (Full Control)
```python
from enhanced_voice_cloning import create_enhanced_voice_cloner

# Create cloner
cloner = create_enhanced_voice_cloner()

# Clone voice with analysis
speaker_embedding, quality_metrics = cloner.clone_voice_from_audio(
    "path/to/voice_sample.wav",
    target_length_seconds=15.0,
    analyze_quality=True
)

# Generate speech with optimized parameters
audio = cloner.generate_speech(
    text="Your text here",
    speaker_embedding=speaker_embedding,
    voice_quality=quality_metrics,
    seed=42
)
```

### Custom Parameter Tuning
```python
# Conservative settings for poor quality audio
conservative_conditioning = {
    'pitch_std': 10.0,
    'speaking_rate': 10.0
}

conservative_sampling = {
    'min_p': 0.03,
    'temperature': 0.7
}

audio = cloner.generate_speech(
    text="Your text here",
    speaker_embedding=speaker_embedding,
    custom_conditioning_params=conservative_conditioning,
    custom_sampling_params=conservative_sampling
)
```

## üìä Parameter Optimization Guide

### Conditioning Parameters
- **pitch_std**: Controls pitch variation
  - High quality audio: 18.0
  - Normal quality: 15.0
  - Poor quality: 12.0

- **speaking_rate**: Controls speech speed
  - Fast speech: 14.0
  - Normal speech: 12.0
  - Slow speech: 10.0

### Sampling Parameters
- **min_p**: Controls token selection conservativeness
  - High quality: 0.08
  - Normal quality: 0.05
  - Poor quality: 0.03

- **temperature**: Controls randomness
  - More variation: 0.85-0.9
  - Balanced: 0.8
  - Conservative: 0.7

## üéØ Best Practices

### Audio Quality
1. **Use clean, high-quality audio** (16kHz+ sample rate)
2. **Provide 10-20 seconds of speech** for optimal results
3. **Avoid background noise and music**
4. **Use consistent speaking style** in reference audio
5. **Check quality score** - aim for >0.5, ideally >0.7

### Parameter Tuning
1. **Start with default parameters** and adjust based on results
2. **Use conservative settings** for poor quality audio
3. **Increase variation gradually** for high quality audio
4. **Set seeds** for reproducible results during testing
5. **Monitor quality metrics** to guide parameter choices

### Troubleshooting
- **Long pauses**: Reduce repetition_penalty to 1.2-1.5
- **Too fast/slow**: Adjust speaking_rate (8-16 range)
- **Robotic voice**: Increase temperature to 0.85-0.9
- **Inconsistent voice**: Reduce pitch_std to 10-12
- **Gibberish**: Reduce min_p to 0.03-0.05
