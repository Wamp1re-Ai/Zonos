        "- **Improved Speech Quality**: Significant reductions in gibberish, better timing consistency, and more natural speech flow.\\n",
        "- **Advanced Audio Preprocessing**: Automatic silence removal and normalization for uploaded voice samples.\\n",
        "- **Voice Quality Analysis**: SNR estimation and quality scoring for your voice samples to guide parameter choices.\\n",
        "- **Flexible Quality Presets**: \\n",

        ", and \\",

        "- **Adaptive Settings**: Parameters automatically adjust based on your voice sample's quality and chosen preset.\\n",
        "- **CFG Scale Control**: Support for `cfg_scale=1.0` (and other values) in `zonos.model.py` allows for fine-tuning the balance between speed and expressiveness. This is benchmarked in Cell 6.\\n",
        "- **Long Text Handling**: Cell 5 now automatically segments very long texts and generates audio in chunks using audio prefixing for continuity.\\n",
        "- **Reproducible Results**: Seed support for consistent audio generation.\\n",
        "- **Google Colab Compatibility**: Streamlined setup and dependency management within the Colab environment.\\n",

        "- Use clean, high-quality audio (16kHz+ sample rate, minimal background noise/music) for voice cloning.\\n",
        "- Provide 10-20 seconds of clear speech for optimal cloning.\\n",
        "- Experiment with different Quality Presets in Cell 6 to find the best match for your needs.\\n",
        "- If modifying underlying code (like `zonos/model.py`), always re-run Cell 3 (Load Model) and Cell 4 (Helper Functions) to apply changes.\\n",

        "### ðŸ”§ If You Encountered Issues:\\n",
        "- **NumPy or other dependency errors**: Try `Runtime` > `Restart runtime` (or `Factory reset runtime`) then re-run cells from the beginning (Cell 1 onwards).\\n",
        "- **`generate_long_audio_from_text` not defined**: Ensure Cell 4 (Helper Functions) has been run successfully.\\n",
        "- **Model loading errors after code changes**: Ensure you've re-run Cell 3.\\n",
        "- **Memory errors**: Try shorter text for generation or restart the runtime.\\n",
        "- **Audio quality issues**: Use cleaner source audio for cloning. Experiment with different presets in Cell 6.\\n",
