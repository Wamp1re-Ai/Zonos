    "# 🎤 Enhanced Voice Cloning with Zonos TTS - Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Wamp1re-Ai/Zonos/blob/main/Enhanced_Voice_Cloning_Colab.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "This Google Colab notebook provides an **enhanced voice cloning system** using Zonos TTS. It's designed for ease of use within the Colab environment and offers several improvements over standard voice cloning approaches, focusing on naturalness, consistency, and control.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key improvements include:**\n",
    "- ✅ Smooth, natural speech flow (reduced unnatural pauses and timing issues).\n",
    "- ✅ Consistent speaking rate.\n",
    "- ✅ Clear, intelligible speech (reduced gibberish generation).\n",
    "- ✅ Stable voice reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Features:\n",
    "- 🔧 **Advanced Audio Preprocessing**: Automatic silence removal and normalization for uploaded voice samples.\n",
    "- 📊 **Voice Quality Analysis**: SNR estimation and quality scoring for your voice samples.\n",
    "- ⚙️ **Optimized & Customizable Parameters**: Choose from Quality Presets for balanced results or fine-tune for specific needs. Includes options for faster generation (lower CFG Scales) and emotional expressiveness.\n",
    "- 🎯 **Adaptive Settings**: Parameters automatically adjust based on the quality of your voice sample and chosen preset.\n",
    "- 🔄 **Reproducible Results**: Seed support for consistent audio generation.\n",
    "- 📜 **Long Text Handling**: Automatically segments long texts into manageable chunks for continuous audio generation with prefixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Instructions:\n",
    "1. **Run Cell 1 (Setup)**: Clones the Zonos repository and sets up the Colab environment.\n",
    "2. **Run Cell 2 (Install Dependencies)**: Installs necessary Python packages using UV for speed.\n",
    "3. **Run Cell 3 (Load Model)**: Loads the Zonos TTS model. **IMPORTANT:** If you modify underlying model code (e.g., `zonos/model.py`), you MUST re-run this cell for changes to take effect.\n",
    "4. **Run Cell 4 (Helper Functions for Long Audio - NEW)**: Defines utility functions for text segmentation and chunked audio generation. This cell must be run before Cell 5.\n",
    "5. **Run Cell 5 (Upload Voice Sample)**: Upload a 10-30 second audio file of the voice you want to clone.\n",
    "6. **Run Cell 6 (Generate Speech)**: Generate speech using your cloned voice and selected Quality Preset. Handles long texts automatically.\n",
    "7. **Run Cell 7 (Run Benchmarks - Optional)**: Test generation speed and quality with different CFG Scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting Note**: If you encounter NumPy-related errors, especially after installing dependencies, try restarting the Colab Runtime (`Runtime` > `Restart runtime` or `Factory reset runtime`) and then re-run cells from Cell 1. This usually resolves such issues."

    "## 🎉 Enhanced Voice Cloning Complete!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've successfully used the enhanced voice cloning system with Zonos TTS. This notebook provides a comprehensive suite for voice cloning, generation, and performance benchmarking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 What's Enhanced & Key Features:\n",
    "- **Improved Speech Quality**: Significant reductions in gibberish, better timing consistency, and more natural speech flow.\n",
    "- **Advanced Audio Preprocessing**: Automatic silence removal and normalization for uploaded voice samples.\n",
    "- **Voice Quality Analysis**: SNR estimation and quality scoring for your voice samples to guide parameter choices.\n",
    "- **Flexible Quality Presets**: \n",
    "    - Choose from presets like \"Conservative\", \"Balanced\", \"Fast (Less Expressive)\", \"Expressive\", and \"Creative\".\n",
    "    - \"Fast\" preset uses a lower CFG Scale (1.5) for quicker generation with a trade-off in expressiveness.\n",
    "    - \"Expressive\" and \"Creative\" presets now incorporate specific emotion vectors for more vivid speech.\n",
    "- **Adaptive Settings**: Parameters automatically adjust based on your voice sample's quality and chosen preset.\n",
    "- **CFG Scale Control**: Support for `cfg_scale=1.0` (and other values) in `zonos.model.py` allows for fine-tuning the balance between speed and expressiveness. This is benchmarked in Cell 6.\n",
    "- **Long Text Handling**: Cell 5 now automatically segments very long texts and generates audio in chunks using audio prefixing for continuity.\n",
    "- **Reproducible Results**: Seed support for consistent audio generation.\n",
    "- **Google Colab Compatibility**: Streamlined setup and dependency management within the Colab environment.\n",
    "- **Benchmarking Tools**: Cell 7 allows for systematic testing of different CFG Scales to understand performance and quality trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Tips for Best Results:\n",
    "- Use clean, high-quality audio (16kHz+ sample rate, minimal background noise/music) for voice cloning.\n",
    "- Provide 10-20 seconds of clear speech for optimal cloning.\n",
    "- Experiment with different Quality Presets in Cell 6 to find the best match for your needs.\n",
    "- If modifying underlying code (like `zonos/model.py`), always re-run Cell 3 (Load Model) and Cell 4 (Helper Functions) to apply changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 If You Encountered Issues:\n",
    "- **NumPy or other dependency errors**: Try `Runtime` > `Restart runtime` (or `Factory reset runtime`) then re-run cells from the beginning (Cell 1 onwards).\n",
    "- **`generate_long_audio_from_text` not defined**: Ensure Cell 4 (Helper Functions) has been run successfully.\n",
    "- **Model loading errors after code changes**: Ensure you've re-run Cell 3.\n",
    "- **Memory errors**: Try shorter text for generation or restart the runtime.\n",
    "- **Audio quality issues**: Use cleaner source audio for cloning. Experiment with different presets in Cell 6.\n",
