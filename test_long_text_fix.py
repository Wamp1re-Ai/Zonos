    This is a very long text that would previously cause issues with the Zonos TTS system. 
    The old token calculation would cap the generation at 30 seconds (2580 tokens), regardless 
    of the actual text length. This would result in silent gaps and incomplete audio generation 
    for longer texts. With the new improved token calculation, we remove the hard 30-second cap 
    and use a more dynamic approach based on the actual text length. The system now estimates 
    approximately 15-25 tokens per character and sets reasonable bounds with a minimum of 1000 
    tokens and a maximum based on text length, capped at 2 minutes for very long texts. This 
    ensures that long texts are properly handled without silent gaps while still maintaining 
    reasonable generation times and memory usage.

    This is an extremely long text that demonstrates the new chunking capability of the enhanced 
    voice cloning system. When text exceeds the maximum chunk length (default 200 characters), 
    the system automatically splits it into smaller, manageable chunks. Each chunk is processed 
    separately and then the resulting audio segments are concatenated together with small silence 
    gaps to create a seamless final output. This approach prevents memory issues and ensures 
    consistent quality throughout the entire generation process. The chunking algorithm is smart 
    about splitting at sentence boundaries when possible, and falls back to word boundaries if 
    sentences are too long. This ensures natural breaks in the audio and maintains the flow of 
    speech. The system also provides progress feedback showing which chunk is being processed, 
    making it easy to track the generation progress for very long texts. This is particularly 
    useful for generating audiobooks, long articles, or any content that exceeds the typical 
    length limits of text-to-speech systems.
