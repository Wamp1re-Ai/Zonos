    Segments a given text into chunks suitable for TTS generation.

    The function prioritizes splitting at sentence boundaries. It accumulates
    sentences into a chunk until adding the next sentence would exceed
    max_chars_per_chunk or max_words_per_chunk. A single sentence that
    itself exceeds these limits will form its own chunk.

    Args:
        text (str): The input text to segment.
        max_chars_per_chunk (int): The maximum number of characters allowed
                                   in a single chunk. Defaults to 600.
        max_words_per_chunk (int): The maximum number of words allowed
                                   in a single chunk. Defaults to 100.

The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block has been updated to include the expected outputs for each test case and performs an assertion to check if the function's output matches the expectation. This will make it easier to verify correctness.The Python function `segment_text_into_chunks` for text segmentation has been created. It uses NLTK for sentence tokenization and groups sentences into chunks based on `max_chars_per_chunk` and `max_words_per_chunk`, while prioritizing sentence boundaries.

**Functionality Overview:**

1.  **NLTK Setup (`setup_nltk_punkt`):**
    *   Checks if the NLTK 'punkt' tokenizer dataset is available.
    *   Downloads 'punkt' quietly if it's missing. This is suitable for Colab environments where pre-downloading might not be assumed.
2.  **`segment_text_into_chunks` Function:**
    *   **Input:** `text` (string), `max_chars_per_chunk` (int, default 600), `max_words_per_chunk` (int, default 100).
    *   **Output:** `list[str]` (list of text chunks).
    *   **Process:**
        *   Tokenizes the input `text` into sentences using `nltk.sent_tokenize`. Returns an empty list if no sentences are found.
        *   Iterates through the sentences, accumulating them into `current_chunk_text`.
        *   **Chunking Rules:**
            *   A sentence is added to the `current_chunk_text` if:
                *   The `current_chunk_text` is empty and the sentence itself (if it were the only one in the chunk) does not exceed the limits (this rule is implicitly covered by the subsequent addition logic, but the special case for *oversized single sentences* is handled first).
                *   OR, adding the sentence (plus a space separator if `current_chunk_text` is not empty) does not cause `current_chunk_text` to exceed `max_chars_per_chunk` or `max_words_per_chunk`.
            *   If adding a sentence would exceed the limits:
                *   The existing `current_chunk_text` (if any) is finalized and added to the `chunks` list.
                *   The current sentence then starts a new `current_chunk_text`.
            *   **Special Handling for Overly Long Sentences:** If `current_chunk_text` is empty and the current `sentence` *alone* would exceed `max_chars_per_chunk` or `max_words_per_chunk`, that sentence is immediately added as its own chunk. This ensures that a very long sentence doesn't prevent subsequent, smaller sentences from being processed into valid chunks.
        *   After the loop, any content remaining in `current_chunk_text` is added as the final chunk.

**Conceptual Test (From Prompt):**
Text: "This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence, which is a bit longer. What about a third, much longer sentence that might push the limits of a chunk all by itself, potentially exceeding the character or word count by a fair margin if we are not careful? A fourth sentence. And a fifth."
`max_words_per_chunk = 20`, `max_chars_per_chunk = 600` (default, so word limit is dominant here).

1.  "This is the first sentence." (5 words) + "This is the second sentence, which is a bit longer." (10 words) -> Chunk 1 (15 words).
2.  "What about a third, much longer sentence..." (33 words) -> Exceeds 20 words. Current Chunk 1 is added. This sentence starts a new chunk. Since it alone is >20 words, it becomes Chunk 2.
3.  "A fourth sentence." (3 words) + "And a fifth." (3 words) -> Chunk 3 (6 words).

This matches the expected output:
`["This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence, which is a bit longer.", "What about a third, much longer sentence that might push the limits of a chunk all by itself, potentially exceeding the character or word count by a fair margin if we are not careful?", "A fourth sentence. And a fifth."]`

The code includes a comprehensive `if __name__ == '__main__':` block with multiple test cases and their expected outputs to verify the implementation.

The deliverable Python code is:
